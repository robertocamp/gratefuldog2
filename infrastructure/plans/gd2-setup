Warning: Redundant ignore_changes element

  on .terraform/modules/eks/main.tf line 305, in resource "aws_eks_addon" "this":
 305: resource "aws_eks_addon" "this" {

Adding an attribute name to ignore_changes tells Terraform to ignore future changes to the argument in configuration after the
object has been created, retaining the value originally configured.

The attribute modified_at is decided by the provider alone and therefore there can be no configured value to compare with.
Including this attribute in ignore_changes has no effect. Remove the attribute from ignore_changes to quiet this warning.

Warning: Argument is deprecated

  with module.vpc.aws_vpc.this,
  on .terraform/modules/vpc/main.tf line 25, in resource "aws_vpc" "this":
  25:   enable_classiclink               = var.enable_classiclink

With the retirement of EC2-Classic the enable_classiclink attribute has been deprecated and will be removed in a future
version.

(and one more similar warning elsewhere)
